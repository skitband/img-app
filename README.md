# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project root directory, install using command:

### `npm install`

Validate the docker image:

### `docker images`

Once verified, use this docker command to run the docker image:

### `docker run -it -p 3000:3000 <docker-image>`

if you get this kind of error message "the input device is not a TTY.  If you are using mintty, try prefixing the command with 'winpty'"

### `winpty docker run -it -p 3000:3000 <docker-image>`

Open your browser and goto the app url.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
